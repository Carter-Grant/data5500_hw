#CHAT GPT Q: my code isn't counting values over 5 correctly, how can I troubleshoot this?
#A:the issue with your code is that the graph you created has nodes but no edges. As a result, all the nodes have a degree of 0. To count nodes with a degree greater than 5, you need to add edges between the nodes.
#Hereâ€™s how you can modify your code to include edges and test the function properly
